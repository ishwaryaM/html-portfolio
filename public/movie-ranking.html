<h1>The Best AK Movies according to Ishwarya Murali</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Vaali</h3>

<p>Ajith has acted so well in this movie. He has showcased his acting potential in both protagonist and antagonist roles.</p>

<h3>Billa</h3>

<p>I became fan of ajith from the Billa movie. Whenever he acts in dual role, he is nailing it. So, i wish that ajith does more dual role movies.</p>

<h3>Arambamm</h3>

<p>Ajith exhibited a stylish acting skill in this movie. It's a treat to watch.</p>
